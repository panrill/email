# Email Form Tracking and Data Extraction System - Workflow Architecture

## Overview
This system automates the process of sending forms via email to multiple recipients, tracking their status, extracting data from returned PDF forms, and transferring that data to Excel, with integration to SharePoint/OneDrive for storage.

## Components

### 1. Email Management
- **Form Distribution**: Send emails with PDF form attachments to multiple recipients
- **Email Tracking**: Record when emails are sent and when responses are received
- **Email Processing**: Automatically detect and download form attachments from responses

### 2. Status Tracking Database
- **Structure**: Excel spreadsheet with recipient information, email status, and form status
- **Fields**: Recipient name, email, date sent, date received, form status, processing status
- **Storage**: Saved on SharePoint/OneDrive for accessibility and backup

### 3. PDF Data Extraction
- **PDF Processing**: Extract form field data from returned PDF forms
- **Data Validation**: Verify extracted data for completeness and format
- **Error Handling**: Log and manage extraction failures for manual review

### 4. Excel Data Management
- **Data Transfer**: Populate Excel spreadsheet with extracted form data
- **Data Organization**: Structure data in appropriate format for analysis
- **Versioning**: Maintain version control for data updates

### 5. SharePoint/OneDrive Integration
- **Authentication**: Secure access to SharePoint/OneDrive resources
- **File Storage**: Organize and store forms and data in appropriate folders
- **Synchronization**: Keep local and cloud files synchronized

## Workflow Sequence

1. **Preparation**:
   - Create email template with form attachment
   - Set up tracking spreadsheet with recipient list
   - Configure SharePoint/OneDrive connection

2. **Form Distribution**:
   - Send emails with forms to all recipients
   - Update tracking spreadsheet with sent status and timestamp
   - Save copy of sent emails to SharePoint/OneDrive

3. **Response Monitoring**:
   - Check email inbox for responses
   - Download form attachments from responses
   - Update tracking spreadsheet with received status and timestamp

4. **Data Processing**:
   - Extract data from returned PDF forms
   - Validate extracted data
   - Transfer data to Excel spreadsheet

5. **Data Storage and Reporting**:
   - Save updated Excel spreadsheet to SharePoint/OneDrive
   - Generate reports on form completion status
   - Archive processed forms

## Technical Implementation

The system will be implemented using Python scripts with the following libraries:
- **O365**: For Microsoft 365 email and SharePoint/OneDrive integration
- **PyPDF/poppler-utils**: For PDF data extraction
- **pandas/openpyxl**: For Excel data manipulation
- **msal**: For Microsoft authentication

Scripts will be organized in modules corresponding to each component of the workflow, allowing for modular development and maintenance.
